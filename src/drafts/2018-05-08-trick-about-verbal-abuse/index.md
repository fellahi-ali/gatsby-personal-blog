Ever since reading EF article on Trump and emotional abuse, it's got me thinking about the nature of it. Long time thought overcoming it was about "beating" the other person with logic or perseverance, never seemed to be the case.

Began reading an actual book on the subject. Turns out verbal abuse is about getting someone's attention, riling up emotions, and keeping it that way. Even if both sides get angry, the abuser exercises their power by being able to work up the first person and control the conversation. Getting a response is their exercise in power.

Big takeaway: beating it isn't about there being winners and losers, it's about defusing the hostile feedback loop.

List some tricks the book gives on doing just this:

* Don't take the bait
    - Ask "when"
    - Directly address the real issue
* Boring Baroque Response
* Neutral language to steer the subject away

These all show the abuser you won't play their game, but also doesn't invite retaliation or more hostility for them. No winners and losers, simply defusing the conflict before it gets going.
